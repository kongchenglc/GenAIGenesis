## 🔹 Challenges & Considerations

🚧 **Meeting User Needs**: Some blind users may not frequently use web browsers, so the extension must be **intuitive** with minimal setup.  
🚧 **Voice Command Complexity**: Ensuring **accurate speech recognition** across different accents and speech patterns.  
🚧 **Complex Web Structures**: Websites have **varied HTML structures**, making it challenging to extract **relevant content** (e.g., product descriptions, headlines, interactive elements).  
🚧 **Real-Time Performance**: Ensuring **fast response times** for voice interactions and AI-generated summaries.  
🚧 **Security & Privacy**: Protecting user data, especially **voice recordings and browsing history**.
