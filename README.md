🔹 Key Features

🎙️ Voice-Controlled AI for Web Navigation

✅ Users can search and navigate specific websites (e.g., Amazon, live sports audio streaming) using voice commands.
✅ AI assists with product searches, price comparisons, and checking live sports scores.

🧠 AI-Powered Summarization & Read-Aloud

✅ Extracts key content from webpages (e.g., product details, articles, or action buttons).
✅ Provides a concise summary and reads it aloud to the user.
✅ Highlights available interactive actions, such as “Add to Cart” or “Play Audio.”

🎤 Hands-Free Voice Commands

✅ Users can control the browser via speech input, such as:
	•	“Go to my shopping cart”
	•	“Read the latest news headlines”
	•	“Summarize this article”

🌐 Smart Navigation

✅ Smart Memory: The AI remembers frequently visited websites, providing quick access via voice commands for a faster, more personalized experience.
✅ Seamless Multitasking:
	•	The AI manages multiple tabs, allowing users to switch between them with voice commands.
	•	It provides real-time updates (e.g., “Your sports page just updated the live score”).
	•	AI can monitor important information in the background and notify the user when needed.

🔹 Challenges & Considerations

🚧 Meeting User Needs: Some blind users may not frequently use web browsers, so the extension must be intuitive and require minimal setup.
🚧 Voice Command Complexity: Accurately processing natural language voice commands across different accents and speech patterns.
🚧 Complex Web Structures: Websites use varied HTML structures, making it challenging to extract relevant content (e.g., product descriptions, headlines, interactive elements).
🚧 Real-Time Performance: Ensuring fast response times for voice interactions and AI-generated summaries.
🚧 Security & Privacy: Protecting user data, especially voice recordings and browsing history.
